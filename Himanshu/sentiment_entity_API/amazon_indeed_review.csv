1.0,Terrible place to work in and only recommend if you want your back broken,"Working as a warehouse associate for Amazon is one of the only jobs that accepted me as someone with no previous work experience, but that was the only plus. The benefits are ok if you are full time, but the back breaking work isn't worth $15 an hour. The job is very intense and repetitive and you only get a 30 minute break (unpaid) for the whole 8 hour shift. Under normal circumstances, that is ok- but this job is very labor intensive and is similar to doing CrossFit for 8 hours. You will feel tired at the end of your shift and you will sleep for the rest of your day off. You will inevitably become their sl*ve. Oh and the management is complete cr*p at their job as they are disorganized and overtly rude for no reason.",Warehouse Associate

5.0,Typical day,Typical day I loaded boxes in 18 wheeler truck beds. The hardest part was  standing all day on concrete floors. The most enjoyable part was colleagues and management. There were other employees who told you where to find the exits and break room without complaining.,Warehouse Associate
4.0,Good starting place ,"If you are just starting off in the warehouse/logistics environment, this is a good place to start. Pay is great, benefits are great it ultimately comes down to the work/family life balance as well as management issues. There have been some great management but some not so great management. You have to take the initiative and make yourself move forward, no one is going to hold your hand to do so. ",Process Assistant

1.0,Management gone sour. Work culture for the mentally strong.,"Almost a decade  at a company with no advancement to offer. Management on  nights have become obsessed with numbers to push out, little to no room for safety or quality. Power and greed runs this building. If you don't have a tough skin you will never make it here. Work is repetitive but easy as long as you hustle. Talking is a big NO! Your opinion and or ideas are just that. Micro managed to to full extent. Hustle and go home. Money and benefits keep me here.",Packer
4.0,"Friendly, easy place to work.",I worked for Merch by Amazon SLC on back half nights. I loved it and I would go back if I could. Management is great and the people were also cool. It’s an easy job and it’s entertaining looking at all the shirts. A downside is that the hours are long and late at night you want to die from boredom.,Merchandise Associate

1.0,Not a fun place to work. False job advertisement ,"Amazon is not an employee friendly company.  They will use you and suck you dry. The take off policy is so anti employee. God help you if you get sick for any period of time which requires you to take off for a few days. Thier policy is terrible and they will terminate you with no fair consideration . Also, bad management ",Packaging Associate
4.0,You get what you put into it,"Just like the title says. Willing to put in the work and display their Leadership Principles and you can go far. Its lost its small feel, teams across the company no longer communicate causing poor experience for those on the front line of the company. ",Manager
5.0,"Great place to start, fun &amp; positive work place!!","I started in inbound stow and also was a water spider. I recently transferred to outbound ship dock and like this position best. You get to learn a variety of indirect roles such as a runner, water spider, robot operator and one of my personal favorites is operating the forklift. Management is very positive and friendly to workers from what I’ve seen. They will stick up for you when needed and will help you advance in your job at Amazon if you choose to. I see negative reviews but I encourage anyone to give them a chance and really decide if this is you because these jobs are not for everybody. ",Outbound ship dock
3.0,Truck trailers,They typically would have a lot of lazy people. So if you are hard worker good luck at moving up. You might get lucky and talk to the right people and get a chance at a better position. The abundance of people make it almost impossible for a better position.  ,Warehouse Associate

4.0,"Good pay, good co-workers ","Compared to other warehouse locations, the compensation here is better. Benefits are good as well. Co-workers are usually friendly and helpful.  Management is usually someone that was previously in the entry level which I believe is a plus. The long hours and workload can be very demanding at times. ",Warehouse Employee 
3.0,Hard work. Very short breaks,Its a fast place to find a job as many people quit because the work load is so heavy and the breaks are so short. It is easy to move up in the companyn if you work hard. I come into contact with many co-workers that have been passed up promotions because there is favortism.,Picker/Packer
3.0,The most stressful and dehumanized job I've ever worked,"I would say this is not a good job, however it a stable job that will hire almost anyone and will keep you as long as you want to stay, and for that it is a fantastic option for many, but the turnover rate is very high as everyone is looking to jump ship as soon as they can.",Warehouse Associate
1.0,Its alright,"Working for amazon is honestly a hit or miss and depends on what you think qualifies for a good job. If you're only doing it for benefits and pay then its great! Other than that its trash. Its the HR on site and higher ups offsite that make it a terrible place to work at. I have had multiple incidents where it required me to miss work and I did not have enough PTO or UPT to cover it. They do not care about you or your excuses. I was told they dont accept doctors notes as an excuse to miss work. I had gotten covid after working there for two weeks, and after showing them a positive test result I was told from my ""case worker"" that I was not going to get the covid pay because it was suspected I had forged the test result. After showing them they were wrong they never contacted me back or gave me my back pay. On top of that the first week being back from covid I pulled a muscle in my foot on the job and after going through a lengthy process and keeping me out of work for the majority of the month of may while they knew I could work with accommodations they decided I could come back to work the last week of my recovery. I was told I was ineligible to get workers comp pay for the time missed because I was such a new worker and hadn't worked their long enough. This company is complete garbage.  ",Amazon Warehouse Associate
1.0,High Stress,"The long hours of work 10 - 12 hours a day plus overtime. Standing 90% of work day. Light to heavy lifting 10-12 hours a day. Stressful environment and working conditions. Unprofessional management staff. Employees are responsible for handling their own Human Resources. Amazon does not promote off of hardworking, dedication, skills &amp; dependability, they work off of favoritism. Amazon can afford to pay employees more than it does. They seem to not hire from within like they state that they do.They should also offer 8 hour shifts. Job applicants should be aware that there are possibilities of backaches, headaches, swollen hands, arms, legs &amp; feet, arthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, stress, vision issues, high blood pressure and planters fasciitis, just to name a few.",Amazon Fulfillment Associate
2.0,Just a job,"I worked for Amazon nearly 7 years (until 2010). It was good experience for a foreigner. I made good friends, good money but I was fired for misconduct...  I understand. I messed up. After 10 years (2021) I decided to apply for a part time job at Amazon to make extra money, but they still have my record and wont give a chance. They wont forgive and give a second chance even after 10 years?! Really?!",Picker/Packer

2.0,"Not so bad if you know what you're getting into, I imagine.",Very hard manual labor at times.  When I worked it was post Christmas time and it was non stop.

2.0,Good for some. You can feel left out here,I agree with this.  Everyone is new to the workforce and inexperienced. Not much opportunity to advance regardless of your experience. It’s very much based on how you’re manager feels about you. The pay is low and the hours are hard if you’re on night shift. It’s difficult to get moved to days.,Area Manager
1.0,"Everyone knows the Amazon life, you have no life. ",Amazon is a perfect starter job for kids fresh out of high school. Older people with families and animals. Not a good mix. It's always hard to get time off.

That is incredibly hard to do when you get tired from stowing the heavy boxes and walking 10 miles a day. Short breaks. Mandatory overtime (without being paid time and a half). If you miss more than one day, you are automatically fired (if you don't have the PTO to cover it).

3.0,Productive place. ,"Over worked. Training does not meet my expectations. They train to do one thing. But the managers’ way of doing things are totally different. They throw boxes and packages, not caring if they are fragile or not. There expect you to be perfectly ready to perform the duties with minimum on the job training. Breaks are given sparingly. ",Warehouse Associate
1.0,A Soul Crushing furnace of human sacrifice,"Although the pay and benefits are above average, the culture is destructive. The attitude of most managers is dismissive and ignorant of the reality of the employees, the TOT is very short and there are harsh consequences for taking time consuming tasks such as fixing a computer error or using the bathroom, keep detailed scheduled notes for all activities. Finally for all the harsh disgusting environment, poor management support structures, safety issues and frankly unfair break structure, the worst thing of all is the absolute fear management has for hard working and ambitious employees, you don’t move up without being given the worst duties.","Picker, Packer, Stower"

3.0,Benefits and Pay.,"I took a shot with a warehouse position at Amazon. I started right before holiday season which requires 55 hour weeks. Trial by fire. I can guarantee that if you are new to this type of work environment the first month will be difficult. Beyond that, after you get past the learning curve it's not a bad job. It can strain your personal life because positions like this call for long hours. The pay and benefits are good. I have a medical condition that is controlled through expensive medication. Their standard health plan covers full cost. I honestly thought I would never be able to afford working a job above minimum wage without losing money. They will hire anybody. Seriously anybody. Our work culture is very diverse. The work gets very old and monotonous. It's not built to be long term unless you truly want to stay there. But it's a great opportunity if you need better pay or a bridge job. ",Warehouse Associate

If you're a hard worker and take pride in what you do, then you'll be the one who gets thrown under the bus and have to pick up others slack. HR are some of the rudest people to have to talk to.

1.0,Overworked to the bone,"My first few days there I had someone tell me people don't last more than 3 years and it didn't take long to see why. Management will work you to the bone and you can't sit down! I was a packer which is one of the easier jobs at the warehouse, but it's still a lot of standing and walking from one place to another. Shifts are 10 hours longs with two 30 minute breaks throughout the day. They try not to have any workers just standing waiting for an order so if they don't see you working they will assume you're either slacking off or you don't have any work which then they'll move you to a different place. Getting in touch with HR is the worst! There are 3 different HR's 1.) the physical one in the warehouse. 2.) the outsourced HR in India who have no idea how to handle a situation through no fault of their own, they're given a basic manuscript and if your problem doesn't fit the criteria they can't really help you. 3.) the one that emails you if you go through the app. I would highly recommend staying away from this job, they will overwork you.

3.0,Warehouse Work,"As a picker, a typical day would be clocking in, going to the stand-up to find out what station I'm picking at and going to work. I worked the reduced -time shift so it was a long 12 hours. Considering I have to make a 40 minute commute, I'm always exhausted and the job just isn't sustainable. It's a very physically demanding job and I would not suggest doing it long-term unless you just want to work slow. Working slow means audits and potential right ups. They also micro-manage your time (time-off-task) by when you logged into the station and working. Every second is logged and we only had a 6 minute grace period to use the bathroom if we needed to. Being a warehouse, nothing is a close walk. Don't plan on making a ton of friends unless you're just friendly because there's no way to just talk to people while working.  They do give some leeway in my warehouse, but slacking too much isn't good. Keeping up with their standard honestly won't work in the long-run. If you work hard, good managers will usually recognize that and you could get moved up and trained in other areas though. My manager is great, but I usually never see him because they walk all over the warehouse.",Fulfillment Associate

However, I have heard that people find splitting boring because on a slow day, time does seem to go by extremely slow. I personally loved my amazon location. My operation managers and processing assistants were all nice to me and I loved how flexible my schedule was.

Had proper paperwork but took HR almost 3 months to solve the situation. So it damaged my income for that time.

2.0,Only a good place to work if you like being paid a lot but treated poorly. ,"Our department went through 6 managers in 8 months.  Not because they did anything wrong but they were moved into other positions with lack of focusing on our department.  There is a weird culture of favoritism, bureaucracy, and politics in the work place.  It was difficult to have a work connection with your manager in order for him to see your talents and progress.  You are definitely treated like a number and not a human being.  The ability to advance is challenged in a negative way and not motivated.  Also they take people not qualified to be in management and like to promote those not experienced because it is to cliche of what other companies do.  They feel they can get better ideas from those that have not worked years in a certain field.  Their interview process is ridiculous and intimidating.   They like people who can sweet talk them rather than hiring someone who knows the actual job.   I was only there for 8 months and I didn't even work in a warehouse/fulfillment center. I worked at an office building/call center.  I couldn't imagine how terrible it could be at a fulfillment center but have heard stories.  The pay is great compared to competitors but it comes at a cost.   ",Security Officer (Full-time)
5.0,Considering working for Amazon? DO IT!!!,You will not be disappointed in all this company has to offer. Medical insurance Blue Cross PPO total of $30/month. Manager approval is not required to take off work(just make sure you have the hours to cover absence) Employees take a daily survey on their manager's performance. If he/she is not up to par they are put on corrective action.(I know this bc I've worked on amazon HR Teams). Pay is low compared to similar roles outside of the company HOWEVER Amazon has a Great culture and lots of opportunities to advance and these are only a few of the perks!!,Human Resources Assistant
2.0,Trash place to work. Do not do full time ,"Trash company to work for. It has no limits to the drama and poor management. It’s who you know and not what you are good at. A typical day at work is driving very early to the warehouse to pick up my cities parcels for the day. Making route across the city all day in sometimes hard to reach places and some tough terrain. Some of my clients are in very rural areas. Meanwhile, keeping track of my round of drivers and their progress throughout the day. Logging and keeping track of everything to the mile and minute of the day. It pays. This is timed work. Upper management could be more accommodating when it comes to fuel expenses and reimbursement. The job does not pay that well when you paying for all the fuel. Hardest part of the job would be the homes with no lights, no house numbers and you need to get through farmland to get to the door.

2.0,Definitely Peculiar,"I've never worked somewhere that was such a contradiction. Amazon is indeed peculiar as they like to boast. As long as you don't wear anything offensive and isn't a potential safety concern, almost anything goes. I've seen fellow ""Amazonians"" wear pajama bottoms to work but the going thing seems to be sweat pants. Probably a good idea since alot of the positions are rate driven and the managers will let you know if you're not making it. There is no physical screening for physical dexterity or strength and it's not infuriating for some to not last a week due to the physical demands. Right off the bat, you're given unpaid time off (UPT) that's renewed 4 times a year with 20 hrs.  Might need it too since there is little to no actually training with most of it done by video or power point. No classroon-type environment. Ironic since alot of it IS planned out by day and week. If you're good at picking up on things, might be worth a try. But there's a LOT of repetition in the management role as far as reporting incidents goes and little to no HR support after 0230.

3.0,"Fast-pace, and great Benefits. Slacking management ","Amazon is a great place to work if you like money. But if you also value your Bones, Limbs, and mental health, then this place is not for you. The pay STARTS at 15.80 which is great. It is extremely hard to find a manager when you need help. The first month of working feels like h*ll on your body. You will be in excruciating pain for the first few weeks but eventually it will wear off. It is hard to get accommodations for any medical issue. Anyone that’s not tier 1 tends not to care about you, let alone talk to you. Break is not long enough, only 30 minutes, when it takes a solid 10 minutes to even get from your station to the front door of the building. There are favorites here of course, and even if you’re working your butt off you may or may not become a favorite due to how upper associates choosing their favorites and who moves up based on popularity, Flrting, and only sometimes work ethic.",Picker
1.0,It’s easy till others don’t do their job,"Let me make this short, I was excited to make the bag working here. Turns out the job is relatively easy but here’s the issue, other coworkers just stand around and talk, they don’t at least multi task. They literally make eye contact w eachother and don’t work or scan anything. Some people also don’t scan anything but they give you more boxes or jiffies to scan. They solely move things from the belt to you. If you are one minute late to your shift over the 5 min grace period they take a whole hour from the shift you worked. There is ALOT of favoritism, I’m sure with the amount of people talking to eachother instead of working they would be on TOT (time off task- basically they can see how many times you have scanned, they can write you up for being at 0, usually a manager or PA will look for you and tell you to go scan something cause you are on TOT). instead the MANAGERS or PA or LINE LEADS will join their conversation instead of telling them to get to work. Also what I’ve seen is they scan the lazy people’s badge if they know them and I’m assuming excuse them from scanning so they WONT be on TOT. And then proceed to continue talking instead of working. I am so SICK of this favoritism, another thing if they see you working hard and getting things done they will pick on you to go help clear another lane or go stage or go do extra work. That includes sending you to a lane that has a bunch of lazy people and the lane is backed up so YOU are chosen to pick up the slack since they see you working hard. They only care about productivity. I’ve met only one PA that actually cares",Sortation Associate

Way too many packages were crammed into containers with no care whatsoever and by the end of the night stuff was all over the floor.

3.0,Ok for a Temp job or 2nd job,My only problem with this job was that Management was always telling us that more hours would be available and that never happened. They continued to hire every week even though most current employees could not get enough hours. If you are not available to pick up shifts as soon as they are released then you wont get any hours.

4.0,Productive &amp; fun place to work,A seasonal employee who returns year after year is known as a boomerang. My first year at Amazon was several years before Covid-19. I lived 3 miles away which made for an easy commute. There were several shifts to choose from and they were very lenient when it came to being tardy or taking time off. If I was 5 minutes late I could deduct 5 minutes from my pay without getting any points. Every week we get free cupcakes and snacks. During the summer that we had cookouts and food trucks. The cafeteria also contained video game machines ping pong foosball you name it anything to entertain us or distract us to make it a fun atmosphere. Before the $15 pay raise the bonuses were paid above whatever the amount was so if it was a $50 bonus they give you say 68 so after taxes you get $50.

That's all the training you get, at least for my location &amp; position. I was outbound docks so i had to scan packages and put them on a pallet or cart then deliver said cart to a certain area and repeat. Simple and easy right? Maybe simple but not easy. At least not for 10-12 hours. We had 2 30 minute breaks and somewhere somehow multiple new associates were misinformed about our second break. We were told to clock out for both breaks when in reality we were only supposed to clock out for one since the second is a paid break. We get 10 hours of PTO(paid time off) a year. At the end of my first week i only had 4 hours of PTO when i should've had 6 even though i clocked out for the second break.

The physical aspect of the work environment is either standing for 9 hours or walking around for 9 hours it really depends on if you mind that or not. One of the worst things about working there was the micro management they track how many units you have to put out in an hour they give you speeding tickets if you’re going to fast but they want 1000 units an hour then your breaks are tracked you get 15 minute breaks but it takes about 5 to walk to the exit depending on where you’re at. The social life is terrible there’s no talking on the floor which I can get in some circumstances but not even small talk to the person next to you.

Incompetence was not restricted to my FC, but I heard operational and logistics stories from peers in other newly opened FC's. Covid safety guidelines were not enforced or practiced by upper management. The work is also not fulfilling, so there is immense turnover. Some days we'd have to come in 1-1.5 hrs early and leave 1-1.5 hours after shift. I will finish by adding that I've heard COMPLETELY opposite and AMAZING experiences from other FC's.

1.0,Problems with Training,"I was there for a short time as a contractor, and I couldn't do the job they required because of the failure of Amazon to ship me equipment, poor training, and flaws in the training material. The failure to ship equipment was almost understandable, with everyone working from home and things being chaotic from COVID-19, but it cost me several days when I should have been at work. The training was not relevant to my required work and had significant errors in the tutorial for the CMS the role required. Furthermore, management was creating the rules for CMS implementation as the project went along. Working for Amazon was the most frustrating job I have had because I tried to communicate to management that the tutorial did not address my actual work duties and had fatal errors preventing me from learning what I needed to learn to pass the material. The most discouraging thing about working at Amazon was I had to pass the training course even though it was unrelated to my actual work. Another frustration was the CMS used for the job because it is clunky and outdated, requiring hand-coding of links in the CMS. It was as if no one had heard of a WYSIWYG CMS. Management was nice and pleasant to work with, but training could have been better as well as improvements to the CMS. I didn't last at my job at Amazon, but I'm not sad about it. I won’t ever apply for an Amazon job again because there are better, less frustrating jobs and places to work.",Editor

Covid-19 protocols are nothing more than a front at this point. It’s all about numbers here, so don’t expect to work here and feel like you matter as an individual.

There is a lack of management training that leads to a trickle down problem of no real leadership as most are just trying to hide that they have no support from above and lack the knowledge they need to help. There is a fair argument that they do like to promote and hire certain stereotypes that live in their own self absorbed bubble...these seem to flourish at Amazon as the better managers often leave to other companies and high turnover of good workers and a high retention of those just skating by. For the money, a decent job, but not a real career place.

3.0,Not a job for long term,"I worked in a fulfillment center of Amazon (MKE1) for a little over 3 years. I would tell anyone that if you need to make a quick buck for bills then this is a great place, the work is very simple to understand and do (short term) and you get $17-$18 a hour to do it. Now the work may be easy for awhile but this isn’t somewhere you should work years for, at the most 6 months or a year then leave because it gets very tiring and physically demanding and starts to put a toll on your body. You’ll also not have much time or energy to do much else in life working 10 hour shifts of manual labor for 4 days along with half the time working a 5th day for overtime. Not much work life balance. Like I said short term it can be great but don’t stay too long. Management is a revolving door and you’ll only have a manager about 6 months till you get a new one. Also advancement is possible to become an assistant manager (PA) in a year or sometimes less but you only make $1 or $2 more just to still have to lift heavy things, run around everywhere, fix stations and on top of all of that have to deal with your employees attitudes and rude behavior which to me doesn’t seem worth it. After a PA position, don’t expect to become a manger because most are hired from outside (college graduates) and making OPS is nearly impossible for the average person with no degree.

3.0,Long hours  . No sick time. ,Long hours  . No sick time. UPT system is a joke. HR's system is horrible and needs work. Amazon also doesn't believe in a phone and everything is through an app. The system is very faulty. I should be able to call my manager.,Warehouse Team Member

3.0,Great opportunity but exacts a toll,"Amazon can be a great place for advancement as the culture is very focused on learning, there are many stretch opportunities, and the culture does support promotion from within. Amazon will push you to grow and develop new skills.  The downside though is long hours and high stress which can lead to burnout. There is very little in the way of work/life balance. I really appreciate Amazon's focus on doing right by the customer but find that same focus lacking when it comes to doing right by employees. ",Sr. Program Manager
5.0,Would recommend ,"It was amazing working there. I was in the packing department and it was really fun. I made several friends and the management was very supportive.

4.0,Decent job ,"It's an Amazon warehouse. You are on your feet 10-12 hours a day. They have different shift types and start times that are really flexible which is the best part. The pay has barely gone up in the Orlando location. It was $15 an hour in 2018, it's still $15 an hour in 2021. Pay increases depending on shift type, but if you want a slightly less physically stressful job, I recommend a lot of other employers in the area paying the same or more with better benefits (Target, Disney, Publix warehouses, and so on). You probably won't ever know who your manager is. The job can be extremely boring to some, but it's a decent job for anyone who isn't a fan of customer service and doesn't want to be social with people. It's easy to move up if you put in the work and they have different opportunities to do so, overall, it's a decent job with decent pay and the perfect job to blend in and just be a number if that's your thing. If you're looking for more stimulation or social interactions, I'd recommend elsewhere. ",Warehouse Associate

4.0,Good starter job,"If you're looking for a decent start up job this would be it, they let pretty much anyone in (age, experience) which also inlays the fault. Most of the people that are hired on are younger college students that have no work drive or even desire to be there. Every shift I ever worked always had groups of young people standing around talking instead of doing their job for the short 4 hour shifts. If there was ever volunteer time to leave they would always be the first ones to jump on it and be the first ones to complain if we ever had to stay 5 hours, and do the most minimal work possible during the last hour. Some (not all) supervisors would spend the shift talking to other supervisors rarely about work which lead to associates being left unattended. Like I said good starter job or job to make a bit of side money but not a place to start a career.",Amazon Fulfillment Associate

The PA’s ended up using me for the more intensive manual labor tasks that no one wanted to do and some of those tasks were the PA’s own problems to deal with. I would bust my butt while people getting the same pay would sit down and talk and relax most of the day it felt similar to communism if you ask me. Oh and managers do not do anything but show up when they have a problem with the worker because the computer tells them to,  they are no help for any questions not even HR. Communication within the building is a joke. Luckily for me this was just a job to pay bills while I was attending school but I gave it my all because that’s how I was raised regardless of the negative and lazy coworkers and horrible management that do nothing but look at a laptop and the lazy PA’s that climbed the ladder to lose their hard work ethic because they can.

For the picker position you are ALWAYS timed to make sure  you have 320 items an hour by the end of the day, this means that you need higher than 320 items because your timer doesn't stop when you need to use the bathroom, or go on your mandatory brakes, so in another ways you are always behind on your picker items, so you can practically be fired at any given moment. in my experience that when ever I was doing well the managers/supervisors would stop by to see how my work was coming along and would try to chat with me, but I'm trying not to stop as to keep my numbers, but they insist that you take part in the conversation making you fall behind only to in a few minutes come back to ask why your falling behind MAKING YOU FALL BEHIND EVEN MORE!!! Now you wouldn't think being in a small place all day would be too bad doing mindless tasks, but my last day I counted 600+ squats in one day! The tasks are pretty easy, but at the speed your going at you can't think of anything else but what you are doing, you cant listen to music at all, cant sit down at all, and this place is so dang loud they offer hearing protection as an option, BUT you can only use two of them a week!",Amazon Warehouse Associate

Take advantage of all benefits - they're great! I obtained this job with the hopes of Amazon helping with my tuition; however, this was highly misleading.

You are not allowed headphones at all (understandable) but you're also not allowed to talk while at your stations; however, there are many who break these rules and don't receive any feedback, but there are others that do, so the discipline is unfair and biased toward the ones the managers like.

Yes, you can pick shifts, but don't get excited because there's almost no shifts to pick from. It's first come, first served, and you get no notification when shifts are posted in the app. You're then stuck picking 7p-11:45p shifts and 12am-5:45am shifts. Not only that but these shifts aren't long enough. No more than 5.75 hours at a time. 120 hours a month wouldn't be so bad if you could pick better shifts, and if the shifts were longer.

3.0,Delivery job,"Working with Amazon had its up and mostly downs, but still I do admit I had the most fun time working there, to clarify I got hired directly from Amazon as seasonal, and it was delivering packages around the California Valley. It first started out great, Amazon was paying thier employees alot more then fedex, ups, etc. At the time. They even had great benefits, but it was limited to the seasonal employees. Nonetheless the job task in hand was very simple, drive a van and deliver the packages in a fast save matter. You were always on your own, at times you would get a helper, but that was soo rarely. In the summer time you would receive free ice cream when you finished your route. Many cool people to meet, and one awesome leadership that worked there. Sadly management is terrible, when it comes down to moving up in Amazon. In fact everyone that worked with Amazon that was seasonal got a write up for the most dumbest ways possible, in all honesty it was a miscommunication because they never told us what rules were added or taken out, thus getting write ups for everyone. Overall I loved working there, in fact I would have devoted my career for Amazon. But because the management, and firing all seasonal employees (because we were about to reach the 1 year mark, and gave all the jobs to the contractors) they saw us as useless...so that's how I experienced the all mighty powerful Amazon, no I didn't work at the warehouse, so I heard alot of bad things for them. But yea..",Delivery Driver
3.0,"No opportunity for full time schedule, no true advancement or realistic promotional opportuntities","It’s good for a part time job, because that’s all they let you work there. They claim to offer full time, but it’s a secret that only managers can even get that. So any actual normal employee can’t get full time, only management. Some managers can be nice and appreciative, but most disrespect us or just don’t value us at all. They treat us ALL like we’re lazy children, instead of only treating those who deserve it like that. They don’t even care because they get paid a lot to walk around and point their finger, so they don’t waste their time recognizing good work. They just walk up and make a comment and move on, before they sit down for an hour. After 6 months of working as hard as I can, only to be treated equally with the worst employees, I now do not push myself anymore as I see there is no reward for it. You only leave with an aching back, meanwhile the guy next to you is on his phone all day and still making every penny that you make, with no threat of being fired. So unfortunately, you are the fool if you give them your all, because they don’t care. You’re best off taking it easy and being average at your job, because they expect that and they will not honor you. ",Associate
4.0,Straight forward and repetitive job ,"I worked at a delivery station. The job was straight forward but repetitive. My hands, legs and feet would be sore almost everyday. If you work the full time shift good luck, this will be your life. If you work the part time it’ll be pretty easy. Management is okay, make friends with one. It’ll be easy to move up that way and get put into better roles. If you don’t care about that, then it’ll be easy to just go in do your job and leave. They say no headphones, but I worked there 2+ years and I wore them everyday. ",Sortation Associate

The leaders spend most of the day yelling at you for every little thing. I got yelled at for standing and trying to clock in on my phone. The pay is terrible for the work you do and for how you are treated. You can't listen to music which is so stupid.

They only care about their bottom line.  In the group of people hired at the same time as me which was about 12 of us there were only 4 of us left after about 3 months.  The work is extremely tedious.  The management is horrible and they are never around when you need them.

Actual everyday on the job is totally different. I like a job were I work and keep busy and that's one think I liked about Amazon. But don't like environment were an employee gets penalized and treated subhuman cause of their disability. They might treat other disabilities well but not all and all employees should be treated well and as human beings. Pay should be increased cause it's higher if employed via temp. agency and that $16+ should be standard if hired thru Amazon.  Amazon also needs to have more regard for employees and get rid of timers cause going to bathroom is part of life. Should be more concerned about handwashing cause some employees don't probably cause of timers and nasty hands put others at risk. Amazon could be good place for all employees if p.r. was actually applied to real workday and would help with employee retention. ,Customer Service Representative

Then I have to forfeit my breaks to hunt HR down to get it corrected which still doesn't happen 50% of the time. When that doesn't work I have to contact the leave personnel...again. I also have to mention the constant ""do you wish to resign"" auto generated emails and texts I get when I'm not there because I'm completing my military obligations. Or being asked by Ops when I return why my UPT time is low or in the negative. It's insulting. Other than that its a pretty blah job. You don't  have to think. But there are unrealistic expectations. So I definitely don't see a future here. Some people in management think a lil too highly of themselves. People are people, regardless of what color vest you wear. So treat them as such. Many also give you different expectations soooo...they clearly aren't on the same page. Which in my opinion creates a lose/lose environment.  A few seem ok though.

1.0,Hard Labor intensive not made for everyone ,"Job is excruciating, not made for anyone. Everyone who believes Amazon is easy for the pay its worth, the pay is definitely not worth the grueling dreariness and despair that is the mega cycle. To work 1am-12 is just sad, the amount of stress and pain it puts on the back. Go home dragging just to wake up the next night feeling the same way u felt when u got off work. Breaks and lunches are barley enough time to ease the pain. Quit Amazon while you can, it’s the best choice for your health and mind. When it comes to work and health, health comes first, don’t throw ur back away for 15 an hour. Rest more or just quit.",Stower/Picker

3.0,Decent place to work,I worked for Amazon for over five years before I left. It was a decent place to work if you worked well.

3.0,The fact that the employee experience is not embraced,"Your typical work day depends on your dept; packing, picking, stowing, etc., and your position; associate, process assistant, learning ambassador, etc. If the workforce at that location is not extremely large, you are able to pick up and learn different positions. Most times you are constantly doing one or maybe two positions repetitively. Workplace culture is sometimes cliquish in the larger facilities, but more personable in the smaller facilities. The hardest part of the job is prolong repetitive work. The most enjoyable part of the job, is sitting down during break. ",Fulfillment Warehouse Associate

1.0,Confident? Feeling good about yourself? Bring balance back to your life with Amazon.,"Unfortunately I fear this is a vision of the future for far too many of us. My location is in Portland Oregon, a city I grew up in and have loved. In the last few years it has gone from a picture post card city to the last stop for the ever growing folks who’ve found their home but a temporary dwelling along a freeway or under a bridge. Making it more fitting Amazon has ushered in the grand plan of distribution and the promise of jobs but behind the curtain they are just domestic versions of the proverbial sweat shops that hopefully you’ve only heard about. This is not the beginning of a career path but another accomplice in the death of the American Dream. They package it in seemingly wholesome glitter but the reality is far more maniacal. If it’s just a brief stay of execution or a place to disappear for awhile in anonymity, this is the place. But bring no illusions or dreams dipped in grandeur, this is a sweat shop job and your the meat that they’ve already calculated the turn over for. If you are young starting out, don’t sell yourself short and seek elsewhere and if you must learn what you can but never accept that your home here for remember AMAZON is a jungle filled with creatures all fighting for life , even at the expense of yours.",Warehouse Associate

During the covid crisis with lockdowns there was extended deliveries and issues obtaining certain products, many entitled people felt the need to yell and cuss you out over something you couldn’t fix.

3.0,Alright place to work,"By no means is working for Amazon as bad as people may make it seem. There's a good work/life balance. You're not allowed to work over 60hrs per week. They won't let you work over 12 hrs in one shift, &amp; you must have 10 hrs off before you;re allowed to work another shift. Plenty of OT opportunities should you want or need some extra cash. Benefits are some of the best I've ever had &amp; pay is pretty good for someone that doesn't have any sort of education beyond high school like myself. BUT, if you're one that takes pride in your work &amp; likes to go above &amp; beyond, I'll stop you right there. Because instead of talking to the other associates and saying you lead by example, they'll ride your butt to improve even more. They give up on low performers &amp; ignore them regularly. Top dogs are watched like a hawk and when they perform average, they'll ask you what's up. As a T1, they're fairly flexible with your schedule. But if you move up the ladder, they're a bit more strict &amp; you might end up working a shift pattern that you're not wanting/willing to work. Management is weird. You either end up with people that'll support you or people that couldn't care less about what happens to you and will treat you like a number over a person. It's not the worst work environment ever. I've had far worse. But this is definitely not a place I wanna work at any longer than I have to. Oh &amp; you better not need to talk to HR about anything. They're practically non-existent &amp; if you for whatever reason need to go on a medical leave, good luck. They make you submit paperwork, then say more is needed, then",Transportation Operations Management

1.0,Okay if you can get shifts,For my duration as a Whole Foods shopper I was dissatisfied with the manner to get shifts through their App. 3 times a week they released shifts which lasted 30 seconds if you’re lucky to tap on 1 that’s when you worked and that’s for only 1 day. I was waking up at 3 am to hopefully get a 4 am shift. You can’t add shifts until you’re finished with the one you started. The on-site manager provided zero assistance in anything. In other words you’re on your own yet timed by metric counts on how long it takes to complete an order. If you take too long the order is taken from you and given to another shopper.  There are no 15 min breaks. Pay was good IF you get work. Left to find a job with steady hours.  Good in a pinch for short term work.  No benefits of any kind - no nothing not even grocery discount. ,Whole Foods Shopper

If it’s busy season and you’re not working as fast as their insane rate of pace then you’re written up. They pop up with mandatory overtime at random and if you can’t bend your schedule to be there for the overtime then you’re written up or fired.

1.0,No benefits for drivers.  DSP owners govern by fear tactics,"Working for an Amazon DSP is a dead end job.  The owners  will post a delivery job to hire people.  They will say it is a 10 hour shift, four days a week.  Amazon pays the owner for 10 hours for every shift they accept.  Then the owner will turn to the drivers and instruct them to get done in under eight hours.  If the driver is not getting done, they can and most likely will be written up.  Amazon makes each route based on a ten hour shift.  DSP owners will ask drivers why they aren't working faster.  If a driver does get done in under eight hours, the owner will have them go take packages off another driver to get the other driver done in under eight hours.  They will then write up the other driver for being ""rescued"".  Routes are rarely corrected.  Drivers don't have access to restroom facilities.  The whole time the driver is doing their job, there is a camera fixed on them recording everything.  Suggestion is to stay away from Amazon.",Delivery Associate

1.0,Internal vs external,If you are trying to be promoted from within the company it is not worth the salary. Internals moving up get paid way less than external outside hires. Another thing is that amazon has a metric to meet on hiring external managers so even when there is spots open for internal promotions they won't allow it to ensure the external metric is met. I am leaving after 3 years of trying to move up because it is not worth the stress and pay. Another thing is that amazon loves to hire rude managers who only care about numbers not that we are people. It is very harsh to work in an environment where I get yelled at for drinking water after hard work.,Process Assistant

Amazon was the place I was looking for and did a good job training me and putting my safety first. It was not flawless however, as I personally lacked a car to get there as the CNO5 does not have very good public transportation options to and from there. Another problem is the constant flex ups (work an additional hour) due to poor management, which happened 90% of the time during my Twilight shifts.

3.0,Monotone work,"The work is monotone and is mentally numbing. You sit and take items from the belt to stack on pallets for 4 hour shifts. Cellphones when I worked were allowed but you were strongly discouraged from using them, it was a ""safety hazard."" The food in the cafeteria is overpriced and was rather bland. You expect the work but at my building it can suddenly have an influx because the Ops managers decided they were backed up, so suddenly enough packages to jam the line would come; That'd be manageable if it weren't understaffed, but you could expect 6-8 T1 employees on a line meant for 18 people; That caused it to back up when the package load was heavy. Most employees either didn't meet scan rate or were skimping bye so you'd be forced to pick up their slack or the line would blue light. That's when you'd be given a ""verbal coaching."" There's basically no perks except Healthcare, Dental, and Vision; Which are good, but the ""other"" perk is $100 off any AMAZON item, did I make that clear? Only Amazon items got thaf discount, which were few and far between. There's no give or comprimise with Amazon, if you can't make it, you can't call out, you have to use the unpaid Time Off they alot you, which is only 20 hours every quarter of the year. They offer three types of employment, part time, Reduced time(32hr), and full time. However, be ready because they can flex you up as little as 20 minutes before the end of your shift and now you have to stay an hour later or use your time.

Employees are constantly stressed by productivity reports that are not completely accurate and employees that do follow policy are often in danger of bad reviews by customers because of not just giving in to the customer which in turn affects the employees productivity reports.

Promising one thing, then delivering the other while smiling all the same. You'll move boxes, and you WILL have people hounding you to do more of what you already are doing.

3.0,Can never get used to it,"My shift starts at 3:20 am, which is super early for someone wanting to work a 9am-5pm job. However, if you are willing to wake up that early it might be for you. On the plus side, you come home while the sun is still up and you can do whatever errands you need to do once you are done with work, its just for me I can never get use to this schedule. As far as compensation and benefits, it is the typical large corporation benefits with some additional stocks that you can purchase. However, I think the pay could be better because you are doing physical labor after all. Nonetheless the pay is ok and you can get by if you are good with saving money because the pay is weekly unlike the regular bi-weekly that most people that have work are used to. As far as job security, I have yet to see a blue badge get let go. Maybe in really tough situations where this blue badge messed up pretty badly. Moving on to job advancement, it is pretty hard to advance in Amazon regardless of what they post on the A to Z app sharing stories of people who have moved up. You have to be chummy with every manager that there is in the warehouse you work for or else you wouldn't move up in the ranks because those managers are the ones that talk to each other and decide whether they give you a pass to go up or you don't. The management differs from warehouse to warehouse it just depends how the station manager runs it.

1.0,Toxic,Absolute toxic environment to work in. The office was full of people that all have known each other for a very long time as it was in a small town. Their way or fired. If they don't like you or you make them mad then fired. And this firing of employees is encouraged at Amazon as there was/is a certain percentage of people every year they need to cull from the herd. This doesn't mix well with the small cliques of leadership and people that come in to work from outside it. I saw people get fired over insignificant performance metrics only for those metrics to change in a few months to find ways to fire more. Several employees are sick and mentally checked out with a few in my time there being fired from having mental breakdowns and being on physician mandated leave from it. I was eventually let go after a medical leave for not being a good fit for the amazon culture. This was after 2 years of no raise and no reason as to why it wasn't given (was in policy to give reason and was ignored). Stay away from Amazon at all costs and you will be better off long term in both mental and physical health.,Technical Account Management III

Ultimately, the job is good for if you need the money and want to start working asap, but not something you want to be doing for more than a few months/a year.

Overall the work wasn't hard at all and they had systems in place to make sure you weren't working 24/7. PTO was gained fairly quickly and Vacation days didn't take to terribly long to accrue either.  Everybody there can be kind of fun to work with.

It is so much fun managing the flow through the building and making sure everything gets done to deliver the commitment to the customers.  Driving safety and employee engagement....improving the building....thinking about what's next in your career.  It all comes together and creates and extremely fulfilling work environment.  Benefits are the best you can get.  Compensation is generous.  Three days off per week most of the year.  Constant change management and helping folks adjust.  Somewhat political environment when it comes time to evaluate the management crew for sure.  Make sure you are on the right side of the leadership team and you'll do fine.

3.0,Overworked ,"I work as a picker there, and it is tiring work. Shifts are 10-12 hours with one hour break split into 2- 30 min separate breaks. If you work 12hrs you get one last 15 min break. Working overnights and on the weekends you get a shift differential pay of 2.50 extra on top of base pay, which is nice. 12hr shift is too long and it’s physical work. You do get paid weekly, and can use the pto, vacation you accrue when you want. But with that in mind you have to manage it wisely, ex. Covering the time you come in late, or have to leave early. You have to work one mandatory OT shift in a week when needed. Overall I would have stayed if pay was kept the same for day time for less hours. Turn over is very high so a lot of management don’t bother to introduce themselves. ",Picker

3.0,Alright but exhausting,"It’s not a bad job to have really but it is super tiring to work there.

Working there is okay too. There are so many different types of managers, no one really knows who to go to for their concerns. If you plan on working here, invest in memory foam running shoes! Your feet will thank you I promise you. The ones they offer you on Zappos are not comfortable!! It’s decent money too, you won’t make anything less than $15 an hour and obviously you’ll get more for working weekends or overnights. I’ve known a few people making $20 an hour for entry level positions. Benefits are good, your first year you get 4 and a half vacation days, 4 paid time off days, then it goes up each year.

They hire college graduates as new managers, so of course they don’t know what it’s like working from the bottom. Their internal interview process needs to be more towards the actual position instead of asking the same questions from their question bank. The STAR method is easy to get a hang of, but it’s still dependent on who does your interview. The work hours are long and the concrete floor has messed up my feet and lower back.

Just know that you can't say anything to the customer in a bad way and also you need to finish your calls quickly or else you'll get pulled aside by your manager who is never present unless there is news or you did something wrong. The structure of the customer service sections is very disorganized. Don't be surprised if someone from another department transfers a call to you and you have no idea what to do.

Team leads are hit or miss - I found that team leads who have moved through the ranks at amazon are truly amazing while external hires cannot provide the same knowledge and support. Ultimately, I couldn't handle the stress or hours. The thing about providing customer service over the phone is that customers feel a sense of anonymity and some will treat you horribly without breaking any of the rules needed to be able to elevate the call. There's usually very little time to destress from calls. Paid training, pretty nice.

They’ll change your schedule whenever they feel necessary, they’ll offer you transfers to different stations and threaten employment separation if you decline the offer. But, I can say that this company has showed me no matter how big and successful hard working employees can make a business, they’ll still deliberately show you how little they care about you, they treat employees like property, they’re too rich to care.

It's a lot dealing with this company, and they have no compassion for the employees. I've suffered from heat exhaustion on a 187 stop route, in 95 degree weather. ",DSP/Driver
2.0,See below.,"There's little to be said here that hasn't already been voiced by so many people. Amazon pays fairly, has a robust system in place that will help you along, and the work, while mundane and physically taxing (especially if you work an overnight shift- very deleterious to your health) is not really cruel or overwhelming. It's just that the overall experience has no soul. ",Stower

2.0,Pay is ok if you have no other option ,They will fire you based on their own system glitches. They will also bait and switch you as to what building you will work at.

2.0,No cohesiveness throughout the departments,"They had a great idea to incorporate the department but there was not set guidelines or policies for the process implementation.  The suggestions given to management were rarely implemented.  When problems/issues were presented, the response was always, ""we're working on that"" with no evidence of resolutions.  Extremely difficult to advance in the company without knowing someone that will push for you to get another position.  Your education/experience is not enough for you to get another position or keep a position. Amazon is definitely about who you know.",ERC Disability and Leaves Services Agent

3.0,Amazon Warehouse Employment,I was initially excited about the opportunity to work for Amazon until about week 5 where I started to not enjoy going to work.  The positives: I loved my team of associates and the work was challenging.  The negatives: My manager became less supportive of me as time went on.  There were 43 separate applications available to manage work and associates.  Associates often would not come back after breaks or lunch without any notification.   Warehouse environment wasn't for me.  Wish I had a better experience.,Inbound Area Manager

The only issue I had was it’s very easy to get terminated. Don’t take a shift unless you are 100 % sure you can do it because a couple points and you will be terminated. It’s the perfect job for people in school or people who need extra money and want to choose when they go to work. ",Whole Foods Shopper

The pay is decent for the level of skill needed, but it could be better. Management sort of sucks especially when there’s always a new one fresh out of college telling everyone how they should do the job they’ve done for years. The place is a revolving door for management and associates alike, there’s always someone new and everyone’s expendable. There’s a severe lack of appreciation with this company.

1.0,Horrible place to work,There’s a lot of favoritism that happens at Amazon. In the 8-9 months I have worked here they have hired 10-15 new people a day. Which makes us get sent home early a lot due to no work. The management was not good. A lot of the changes that would happen the employees wouldn’t learn about until the day they took affect. I highly recommend not going above and beyond because if you are getting a higher rate but mess up you’ll still get introuble as if you didn’t just go over your limit. Over all highly don’t recommend working for Amazon. If you can I would find a different job. ,Picker/Packer

However it doesnt come without the negative. You’re basically a first aid employee. You rarely use your actual EMT skills at all. Just know you are not an EMT like in the field. You push a lot of paper work. If you can wrap your head around that, it’s a great position that will take care of your family and finances. Lots of overtime. ",Onsite Medical Representative

5.0,Multiple career paths with advancement opportunities. ,"Although Amazon provides good benefits and an easy to use PTO system, the overall pay compensation for employees is minimum wage and bonuses are heavily taxed. They do not seem to appreciate their veteran employees and have a very young management culture. Ultimately, it feels like we are training A.I. to replace us. The overall work environment has lost its sense of employee ownership and family oneness to become very segmented and corporately deterministic. Inconsistent hiring wages is unfair when new hires in the same building doing the same job get paid at various hiring wages. This is once again benefiting an untrained new hire to a veteran employee who will teach them how to do the job?!",Amazon Fulfillment Associate

The team supervisors were amazing with trying to find little tasks I could perform to make sure I wasn't losing out on a ton of hours, but in the end their hands were tied and there wasn't much they could do. One other thing I found very inconvenient as an employee is that there are HR personnel in the warehouse, but any HR questions employees had to call a 1-800 number for.

3.0,Speed and consistency ,So to work at the fulfillment center in packaging you have to get a rate. So if you been there a month your rate has to match someone of the same time frame. Guess what 180 pieces an hour isn’t good enough if the next guy can pack 300. Write ups happen and you have a week to improve or you get a second one another week to improve and a third one happens then you get fired. ,Packer
2.0,Should be paid more for the amount of strenuous work they expect from you,"They work you entirely too hard on the line for the pay they offer. The Packers are too worried about speed and not quality and are a cause to a lot of jams that occur on the line. Voluntary time off has its pros and cons. One good thing about it is that you can leave without attendance being an issue. The bad part is that you only get paid for the time you worked, they offer it as soon as the shift begins or 2-4 hours after the shift started, and they send way too many people home when they know there is never a moment where we're not busy. Management is horrible. Rarely any team work. Lunch should be at least an hour. Benefits are fine",Amazon Fulfillment Associate

The managers are ehh, it definitely doesn’t seem like a place you can easily work yourself up in, they make it obvious you are replaceable and they really don’t need you. I had a 40 year old learning ambassador continuously hit on me knowing that I’m 18. Creepy, very creepy. They hire anyone and everyone so you there could be a bunch of weird people working because Amazon really doesn’t care if they hire pediphiles and drug addicted I guess.",Warehouse Associate

3.0,fast-pace and high energy,"if you're looking for a stress-free environment, amazon is not the place for you. working for the database portion of amazon (so they can assess your performance and see where you’ll fit when working for the actual franchise) was extremely taxing. not knowing your placement, what section you’ll be working in along with the feeling of being watched (because you are) were all factors in mentally and physically draining. if you’re into fast-paced, ever-changing roles in the warehouse this is the perfect place for you. the co-workers are friendly and the “fun” environment keeps you energized. the breaks are quick to leave as they are to come and you’ll be on your feet most of the day.

3.0,"Fun job, excruciating back pain.","Working in the Amazon warehouse was a lot more fun than I had expected, but also a lot more painful than I expected. Even with decent shoes my body can’t handle standing 10 hours a day on the concrete floors, doing 20,000+ steps a day. There is little downtime and you are constantly busy, so no real time for your body to catch a break. The 30 minute breaks aren’t long enough for your body to recover either. Working at peak for 10 hours a day isn’t healthy nor is it sustainable. Amazon’s customer obsession comes at the expense of their employees physical health, unfortunately. It’s now quite obvious to me why their staff turnover is 150%. I went in expecting a toxic work environment with horrible managers, and found great people and managers with a job that destroys your body. I’ve worked in jobs where I have been on my feet 12+ hours a day, they pale in comparison to the Amazon warehouse. $15.50 an hour isn’t worth causing long term damage to your physical health. I rated it 3 stars because if you can handle the physical aspect, I think it would be a great place for you to work. For me, no amount of money is worth the excruciating back pain. ",Tier 1 Associate

2.0,Lots of time off options,"Other than the time of options that are available to you and the benefits, there really is nothing good about working at amazon. Managers get changed every 2-3 months and each set of managers have their own group of ""Favorite"" associates. Apart from 2 of the managers I worked with, who knew what they were doing, every other manager either screwed up the outbound process or was completely clueless. The PA's were usually more helpful than the managers were. Getting hold of the HR department was easy when it concerned easy and simple HR related questions but wen it came to the more complicated inquires, HR personal would just close the HR cases without replying or solving anything and trying to get in contact with them was pretty useless.

I'd recommend learning critical roles so you're not stuck doing the same thing over and over. It can be very mindless work which can get boring over time. They offer voluntary time off which can be addicting if you don't really need the job. If you need a job, don't care what you do, and want to work the extra time then go ahead.

I won't get out of work till 12:30 a.m. or even 1:30 a.m. Then I'm expected to attend school the next day at 8:30 a.m. I've talked to Human Resources but still nothing. They tend to flex up a lot: meaning they add time to your shift. They can add up to an hour. And they will tell you 2 hours before your shift ends. That's what makes a lot of people want to leave. The pay is not too bad but you would need to work a lot of days to get a good pay. I only work 4 shifts and make $300 maximum. There are 401k plan and health insurance. ,Amazon Fulfillment Associate

Half consisted of calling customers to get updated/missing info such as apartment #’s, gate codes, etc so that we could get the packages to them and the other half consists of taking, processing and shipping off returns.

No selection where you are going to be pout. I wish theyd at least try to give you an option, especially for a seasoned warehouse worker. I dont want to be packing 2 pound packages all day. Put me in the warehouse where Im going to sweat for a reason. They should see this at hirirng not just lump us all in one job they need for the week. Training is mostly done on the computer and you do have helpers that walk around you can ask but most of the time they seem to annoyed for your questions. You dont want to stop because look there go your numbers and youll have a person asking you basically why you suck and cant go any faster. I cant say that for all, lot of great people work there however the management is very strict and done by the book. You will get wrote up if you do something wrong which i Had no issues with. If you are slow they will tell you. You stretch every morning, which is fine. Im not a fan of the chants and stuff we do as a group. Just let me do my work of standing there for 10 hours and go home.

The more you learn and more responsibility you take on the easier the job becomes. I am used to hard work (offshore oil rigs) so work load and hot warehouse atmosphere is no problem for me.

The other issue is the scanners and printers you have to work with, sometimes they don't work. Equipment like carts, bags and box cutters are in short supply and many times I have to run around the facility to collect them to do my work.

3.0,nothing I can remember,"When working at Amazon when you are a New Hire they make sure you learn your job and they will give you all the support you need. Once you pass your probationary period it's all about the numbers and getting the merchandise out. You rarely see management unless your numbers are down. You are treated like robots. Please do not get hurt because you are on your own, they really do not care about your health. I have never seen a company give you more of a run around. The HR supports managers rarely follow up on trying to find other work option if you can no longer perform the job you did before you were injured.

2.0,Ok place to work but I wouldn't make it a career,"When you first start you'll be given a different position every day. Sometimes you'll be a package handler, other days you'll be driving the cherry picker or a position they call water spider. Where all you do is switch out the carts for the package handlers and cherry pickers when they get full. They keep track on you all the time for everything. Even when you're in the bathroom.  They give you a 10 minute bathroom break but it takes like 5 minutes just to walk to the bathroom. And if you come back late they will give you the third degree. Package handlers are worked like robots expecting you to pack so many orders per hour. And If you're a picker you have to scan something every 5 or 10 minutes and if you don't they threaten you with ""TOT""  which means time off task. They do have good benefits,  PTO &amp; also offer a 10% discount on  Amazon sold products so there's that. But besides that I'd look somewhere else. ",Warehouse associate

4.0,I enjoy the autonomy of working when I want but I've never ever met my manager since being employed,"This is a good job if you are looking for flexible hours and autonomy of your schedule. Amazon's work culture is well..unique. I would like to get to know my manager if he was ever around when I'm working. The thing that bothers me most would be coworkers who don't follow protocol i.e dress code, coming to wear in BONNETS. Its very unprofessional and distasteful. Like I said, if management was around as they should be none of this would be occurring. On top of that, they've decided to remove the shopper position ENTIRELY. This leaves workers with three options: work at WF without flex scheduling, go to the fulfillment center, or resign from your position. If the scheduling was the same, I would consider transitioning into a team member at WFM but honestly, the staff sucks. Some are nice, but most get aggravated when you need help or a QR code.

3.0,Busy place to work and pay is fair for inexperienced customer service agents,"Initially, you are only given 4 days of self-guided training and then throw on live calls. Honestly, most customers are demanding and nasty, making it difficult to meet the company's time allowed on the call. It is hard to get assistance with less routine calls or difficult customers. Your performance is largely measured by customer reviews. If a customer did not receive a package, they usually give the agent a bad review regardless of how professional, pleasant, and helpful the agent was. It's unfair to place so much significance on something out of your control.  I was ""promoted"" without my knowledge or request to a more demanding position. I was given no training and did not receive a pay increase. Part-time hours are not available even though throughout the hiring process HR says after the initial full-time probationary period, PT is available.  Overall it is a decent work-from-home position, especially for people just entering the workforce. ",Customer Service Representative

Your job is basically ran through an app rather than a person which made it hard to communicate with others and because of that they don’t accommodate to schedules.

They even provide you time off of work to attend class. They have a no interview hiring process for entry level positions, so you basically only have to pass a background check to get hired. These entry level positions are great for people looking for a first job, or maybe a fresh start.

The points system was alright, it was achievable to keep their rate, but they get rid of the worst workers to make their rates go up. Over time the rates will start to be ridiculous. Management seemed pretty bad. Anytime I needed a Manger to ask a question they were never around, or would rake forever to help. Thus causing your rates to drop while you are working.",Picker/Packer

My warehouse was brand new back in august of 2020 and I can say the managers I’ve had and seen there definitely weren’t the greatest. I have asthma and I remember getting told I wasn’t allowed to go grab my inhaler from my bag at the front because I didn’t “need” it and of course I would spend about 3-4 minutes without scanning anything and could potentially get written up for that. The benefits are great and worth it but the job does take a lot out of you after a while, mentally and physically. ",Warehouse Worker

2.0,Dull workplace with nothing to offer but a PIP,"If you like standing still for a minimum of 10 hours, with 2 30 minute breaks and a 15 minute break, Amazon is great for you. If you like listening to music or an audiobook, or have to use the restroom frequently, or get water, or literally anything else that isn’t performing the labor, you’re SOL. Amazon management will micromanage you so hard while performing the most menial of tasks. Having a single earbud in to help pass the time quicker is enough to get written up, but having both of your amazon issued earplugs in and being completely unaware of people talking to you is just fine. Have gastric issues and need to use the bathroom for a little bit? They will write you up for not using “personal time off” if you spend slightly over 10 minutes away from the workstation to work out your problems. HR won’t solve any issues for you, but rather refer you to their employee app, which often is not enough to do the job that you may desire. You are very welcome to express yourself at amazon (pride and all that and such) as long as you take time out of your break to do so. If you don’t like going through metal detectors and such and wearing a clear backpack that will break after 3 days, that also might annoy you. Amazon really is the “worst top level company” to work at due to how data and product driven they are, while trying to persuade you that they care about you as a person (which they don’t). The high turnover rate explains itself. The only good thing about the job is the minimal benefits and decent wage they pay, but it still isn’t exactly astounding. ",Flex Associate

You are hired to be fired in the warehouse. Managers are not properly trained in safety or labor law. This is Amazon's fault, not the manager's fault. Amazon is growing fast and hiring from within. Those promoted aren't trained in regulations for their new role, then 6-12 mons later get promoted again, train a replacement with missing regulatory information, and move up to a new position requiring even more knowledge that isn't taught.

3.0,Productive workplace ,"Overall you need to simply be prepared to work. Lifting heavy items and being on your feet for 10 hours. Which is expected in a warehouse. Managers keep a close watch on bathroom breaks which is odd. Overall scheduling is decent, 4 days on, 3 days off. You get two 30 minute lunch breaks. And overall you won’t have to stay later past your scheduled time which is always a plus.",Warehouse Worker

From toxic work practices meant to guilt or pressure you into doing more than what they're paying you for, no bathroom breaks, if you complain you will be written up, management does whatever the they want, extremely high turnover rate.

3.0,Great to know that we are delivering on promises to our customers,"Amazon is a great place to work, personally for me in the sense that I love the opportunity to coach and develop Associates. I am naturally gifted at building relationships with any team I am a part of through motivating them, listening to them, and assisting them in meeting their goals. Amazon has given me the opportunity to accomplish this goal. However I feel that as an hourly L4 ASM, the base compensation is extremely lacking on the AMXL DS side as the bulk of the time you not only participate in the actual operational flow, but you are also responsible for your own audits as well as completing duties that are above your pay grade and normally without any compensation for the additional workload. Without a proper annual compensation, I am someone who needs OT to make ends meet, and it seems that at the hourly L4 ASM role, OT is pretty much non existent. I feel that the company needs to reset its bar to a year instead of 2 years, for considering associates for internal promotions.",L4 Asst. Area Manager (AMXL DS)

4.0,Its an easy job but it can feel like a dead-end,"The job is easy, mindless work. As long as you hit close to your rates (pack 2 boxes a minute) they'll leave you alone for the most part. You do have to be ok with being on your feet for long periods of time and lifting heavy items though. If you work the 12 hour over-night shift youll have 4 days off so youll have plenty of home time, and youll get paid $2 more. However, I feel like for the amount of work we do and for the amount of money Papa Bezos has, we should be paid more. Every time we learn a new duty at work we should be given a small raise. The thing about not being able to go to the bathroom is kinda true. If you stop doing your job theyll start tracking you, and if you take too long then youll get hours deducted. Also, Ive only been working at Amazon for 1 year and have had like 5 managers. No one stays because a lot of people end up not feeling valued. But if you need a job and dont mind long hours and heavy lifting then its not bad. Oh, and the benefits are top-notch.",Package Handler

5.0,Very fast paced,If your not in physical shape take it slow. But as I’ve told plenty of friends “ With a job working for Amazon WHO NEEDS A GYM”! The job has a lot of heavy lifting and long standing hours. You get 2 30 minute breaks and they are much needed. Training was kind of confusing because they honestly didn’t prepare us enough for what we would encounter on the floor. Training should be more than 1 day honestly when trying to learn to operate heavy machinery and navigate the confusing isles and stay out of the way of other more experienced PIT operators. It eventually comes easy but if there was more training in using the equipment there would be no lag in new trainees running into barriers trying to navigate their OP. Management is so friendly they assist as much as possible. I know I’m a bugger and they don’t lose patience with me asking a million questions (HAHA). But the benefits are GREAT pay is lovely.

5.0,If you are willing to work overtime ,"The task itself is not hard. But it can be repetitive. The mandatory overtime is awful and would take your whole week. which is overwhelming to any human being. The worst part is knowing you have overtime by other workers, out of nowhere without any previous alert, so be prepared for a sudden unpredictable overnight shifts. They don’t tell you anything, so say goodbye to any personal life as a human. Management can be terrible at times. You’ll stand up for Long hours, you are not allowed to put on your ear-pods which is unfair, so overall you are just a machine a number for them nothing more or less. My advice would be don’t work hard work smart; because apparently they don’t like you to finish all the work and want to keep you working as long hours as possible. Also do not expect to get the acknowledgment you deserve. ",paking

Do they go for the long hard road of fixing an issue, or do they put a bandaid on it? Do they “Think Big” and not sacrifice long term goals for short term goals or...put a bandaid on it?

1.0,Run far away from this company you deserve better,Been working at Amazon for about a year. It's ran by a bunch of people straight out of school with a degree and not much management experience. Their interview process is a complete joke and is solely based on a five star interview process they have came up with and previous job experiences with multiple years experience mean absolutely nothing. Interviews are conducted with management of the building that are in close contact with the employees around them. So they know who they are gonna hire for the job before the interviews which doesn't make it a fair an equal opportunity. It also doesn't pay to go above and beyond at this company because I have seen the people who slack get the job advancements before the hard workers that are the backbone of the company.

1.0,Messy and a terrible place to work ,It's a high school mentality the people there are ok you'll probably better get along with the older crew (50 and up). The management is horrible they try to find any and every reason to fire you or write you up. You can't really trust anyone there because even the people who you talk to will throw you under the bus if it means getting ahead. Alot of the managers are conceited and don't have any drive to help or see tier ones move up to higher positions. You can't trust anyone in HR they will all turn on you friendly or not. Plus they monitor your every move anything over 10 minutes of down time is time off task and if you accumulate 2 hours of it within a work day it's an automatic termination. It doesn't matter if your area doesn't have work and you explain it to a manager or not. Bottom line is if your manager isn't cool with you your out the door.,Ambassador/Trainor/Stower/Picker/Problem Solver

2.0,Amazon has Mastered the Art of Plantation,"This is one of the worst places to work and comparing it to modern day slavery isn't far fetch; Indeed Amazon has mastered the art of plantation. Now I love the fact that they give you a chance without putting much stock to having a resume, but if it's too good to be true, it usually is. I would love to say that working at Amazon could be long-term job, but most people only last a few months. A year at Amazon equals 10 years somewhere else when it comes to your body due to the mental and physical pain that comes with working there. You are under horrible management with no clear direction. You are treated like a number and your well-being does not matter to them. You will not have any support or feel content working there. It's a fast pace stressful environment with constant pain; especially from walking on concrete floor for hours. I have yet to find a footwear that works beyond 4 hours.  Your hard work will be overlooked due to favoritism. You need to be in good condition because you will be lifting weight and walking constantly. The pay may be okay, with flexible hours, and some benefits, but you will work for every single penny you make and beyond that.

You’ll be treated like a number by bothe managers and HR.

5.0,Amazon is itself is GREAT but,"I was working in Akron as part of the away team in April. I been with Amazon for 5 years. Beautiful new building. However only a handful of employees stood out to me. 2 in particular, seem very promising to me 1 was a lady, she understood many of the departments actual correct processes, I think she said she worked for amazon previous, and an older gentleman stood out in docks, they were like a breath of fresh air, finally 2 associates who know what they're doing and talking about. Associates like them were over looked by management. Before leaving to go back to my FC I noticed many people being promoted or being offered promotion. A lot of insight occurred during breaks. I couldn't comprehend how transfers, weren't promoted but new hires were. I've never seen a FC operate the way this one did during my time there. It was the blind leading the blind situation. Meanwhile, hard working and actual knowledgeable associates were being completely looked over for any sort advancement. I hope things turned around there. From what I observed during my 3 weeks there numbers in general were terribly low for a FC standard. Almost everyone was confused about correct processes and what rates actually are.Trainers, ambassadors, process assistants  etc it seemed like if you were an AAs that are friends with management, you were promoted with little to no knowledge of any process.

In one department, they just sneak up on you while you're working as fast as the scanner will let you and tells you you're not going fast enough! They say that you get 2 half-hour breaks, but, having to walk so far to the break areas turns it into a 15 minute break. The culture is very clique-ish. No matter how many times you ask for more training, if you're not part of the clique, you're out in the cold. Turnover rate is very high. Even if you're working every second of every day, they never seem to call out the people who spend half of their work-day texting, talking to their wrists or using the restroom as their personal breakroom.

3.0,Very fast paced environment and long shifts ,"amazon isn't worth breaking your back over for the pay that they want to give you. First of all, i was a outbound picker basically picking out orders and then putting them on the conveyor belt and then it gets packed and then shipped. The hard part isnt that at all its the constant walking and the short breaks that gets to you the most. When you're running low on fuel in a 10-11 hour shift you have to maintain and at that point its all mental and not physical anymore. Management is trash when it comes to actually being managers as well as HR. I've learned at amazon that making friends should be to the minimal and anyone that worked or has worked at amazon knows what i mean when i say that doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure that out. Hardest part was the constant walking. The most enjoyable part was going home, or leaving to go home early but you have to use personal awesome time or PTO i believe. Workplace culture is pretty lit for the most part but it can also get pretty lonely because by like the last break everyone is just burnt out so the communication is very limited.

4.0,Company has growth,"Amazon is a billion dollar company. It pays its employees a decent wage compare to most. It has a reliable schedule so you can plan your days around work. The benefits are great. You can easily grow within the company. However, it is more of a robot job. If you don't keep up, they could easily afford and pursue making a robot to do your job. Go to work, keep your head down, and do your job. In and out. If you can do that, you can succeed at Amazon.",Picker/Packer
1.0,They literally do not care about you here. ,Over worked and under paid. Most of the people you will be working with here are kids fresh out of highschool. Management gets to sit around on laptops while we bust our butts all night long. 12 hour shifts and only a 30 minute unpaid break. Rates that we are expected to make are ridiculously high. You basically train yourself how to do your job. Overall this is just not a good place to work. The benefits are awesome but the work itself just isn’t worth it. ,Warehouse Associate
1.0,Bad,Terrible barely enough time to rest and always constantly working. Terrible work conditions to add onto that. Do not even bother working at this company.,Package Handler
4.0,A good place if you need work.,"A lot of the stories and controversies you hear about Amazon warehouses are pretty overblown. As far as warehouses go it's one of the easier ones and while the pay isn't exactly as competitive as they like to advertise it's not bad either. If you need work then there really is no better place to go, and the work itself is more monotonous and repetitive than actually difficult. They give out overtime like candy.",Warehouse Associate
4.0,Productive, Amazon has Good benefits &amp; easy work schedule.  I love the Flexibility  &amp; you can move up fast if you chose to.  Expect to be on you feet for a little. ,Learning Ambassador
1.0,Hard but rewarding place to work ,"Job was good , just needs a bit of adjusting with the amount of hours. plus the up and down on ladder depending on what your specific job is there.  But overall it was pretty fair job . ",Stocker/Receiver
3.0,Hard work (really hard work) Perfect for single people or people without small kids.,"The place of work is really nice and friendly, but the work is really stressful, sometimes you don't have the tools to achieve your daily goals and de PA and managers want the job to be done fast without taking care about operation failures and delays due to third parties. ",Inbound Problem Solver
1.0,It’s a job,Not really exciting. ,Packer/Picker
3.0,Good company to work for if Leadership Principles are followed. ,"In a fulfillment center, the playing field is not level for all shifts. Manager development is lacking. Favoritism runs rampant. From 2014 to 2021, there have been no Black/African-American Senior Operations Managers, Site Leads, or General Managers in Washington State.   ",Operations Manager
1.0,Bad Management ,Good pay some good coworkers. Easy job to do just bad management. The managers don't know what they doing. Some of them okay but some really don't know what they doing.,FC Associate I
3.0,Strange Promotion Practices,"They don't care about education, even in the field where they make their money, IT.  It's a woke culture, and they're really in a strange corporate lifecycle right now.",Fulfillment Associate
5.0,Great opportunity,"Great opportunities if you are able to keep up and meet the expectations of the Amazon bar. Some people say other roles have poor work/life balance, but I also strongly believe that there are ample opportunities in other functions if you aren’t happy. HR is a great place to be.",Sr. HR Program Manager
4.0,Pay is okay work is really physical ,Pay could be better. Work is very physical. Work 4 10hr days and have three days off. Some over time is required during peak season. Transferring to a different department is har.,Amazon Warehouse Associate
